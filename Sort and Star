TASK
You will be given a list of strings. You must sort it alphabetically (case-sensitive, and based on the ASCII values of the chars) and then return the first value.

The returned value must be a string, and have "***" between each of its letters.

You should not remove or add elements from/to the array.
function twoSort(s) {

}


SOLUTION

function twoSort(s) {
 const sorted = s.sort(); // the default sort function works
  return sorted[0] // take first element
    .split("") // split string into chars
    .join("***"); // join chars with ***
}
